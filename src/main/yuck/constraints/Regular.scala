/**
 * Implements the ''regular'' constraint as specified by MiniZinc.
 *
 * To understand the cost model, let q denote the last state (the state after processing
 * the last input, it may be failed) and let 0 <= i < n denote the position at which q was reached.
 * (If q != 0, then i = n - 1.)
 * We aim to compute the length l of the longest prefix that could be extended to an acceptable
 * sequence in order to return the ''backtrack distance'' d = n - l as a measure of constraint violation.
 * (The notion of ''backtrack distance'' derives from the imagination of a tree search with the
 * fixed variable ordering xs[1], xs[2], ...; it is not the Hamming distance but, obviously,
 * when d = 0, the sequence is acceptable.)
 * Actually we compute an upper bound l' of l and hence we return a lower bound d' on d.
 * We guarantee that d' = 0 iff the sequence is acceptable.
 * To compute d', we look for the latest state u from which an accepting state could presumably be reached.
 *
 * Presumably, d = d' under the following conditions:
 *  - The domains of the xs(i) allow for the transitions required to reach an accepting state from u.
 *  - Once in an accepting state, the DFA can stay in that state or oscillate between accepting states.
 *
 * @param xs Sequence of input variables (may contain channel and duplicate variables)
 * @param Q Number of states
 * @param S Number of inputs
 * @param delta State transition function 1..Q x 1..S -> 0..Q (0 is failed state)
 * @param q0 Start state in 1..Q
 * @param F Accepting states (subset of 1..Q)
