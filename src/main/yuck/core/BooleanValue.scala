/**
 * Implements immutable Boolean values with non-negative violations.
 *
 * A zero violation means "true", a non-zero violation means "false" to a certain degree.
 *
 * Values are compared by violation and hence:
 *
 *  - The smaller the violation, the smaller the value.
 *    In particular, "true" is smaller than all "false" values.
 *  - "false" values with different violations are different and therefore direct comparison
 *    is discouraged; use truthValue instead, it's safer and more efficient than equals!
